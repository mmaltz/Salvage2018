#Salvage topsoil was removed from a donor site and delivered to three recipient sites in 2015
#I sampled all sites (Donor and recipients) prior to topsoil delivery
#sequenced AM Fungi from all sites in 2015 and 2017 in manipulative plots employed in a randomized block design at all sites with control treatment (no topsoil added), and then dusting of topsoil, then three thicknesses of topsoil delivery (2", 4" and 6" think layers of topsoil delivered to all sites)
#Questions:
#Q1: Propagule determination: Do AM fungal communities resemble the donor site, irregardless of where soil was delivered?
#Q2: Environmental filtering: Do AM fungal communities resemble the recipient sites, and are more dissimilar to the donor sites
#Q3: Propagule pressure: Do AM fungal communities resemble the donor site more in thicker topsoil layer treatments than they do in the control or dusted sites?
